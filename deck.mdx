# Introduction To Git

# What and Why Version Control?

- Keep track of changes to the code
- Revert bad changes
- Allow multiple people to work in parallel more easily
- Git is but one of many *distributed* version control systems
    - Mercurial
    - svn

---

# Key Definitions
- **Repository** - a git "project"
    - has all the *current* files
    - but also all the *history*
- <b>Branch</b> - a split from the "main line" so you can make changes without messing with the main line
- <b>main/master</b> - (by convention) the name for the "main line" branch

---

- **commit** (n./v.) - a unit of change/the act of making that change
- **merge** - bringing the changes from one branch into another
- **rebase** - relocating where a branch splits from its parent

---

## Branches
- `git checkout <id>` moves `HEAD` to `<id>` (which can be a branch name, a commit hash, a tag, ...)
- creating a branch: `git checkout -b <branch name>`
    - short for `git branch <branch name>` + `git checkout <branch name>`

---

## Making a commit.

<Image src={status} style={{maxWidth: '75%', maxHeight: '75%', objectFit: 'contain', backgroundSize: 'contain'}} alt='foo'/>


<ImageText>

```
 ~/dotfiles   setup_scripts  git status
 On branch setup_scripts
 Your branch is up to date with 'origin/setup_scripts'.

 Untracked files:
   (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
           git_aliases/
                   nvim/.config/nvim/.netrwhist

                   nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
```

</ImageText>

--- 
## Making a commit

- `git status`: see what files have changed
- `git add`: stage each file that you want to commit
    - tip: `git add -p my_file.py` will show you all changes individually and ask if you want to stage them
- `git commit`: make the commit
    - shortcut: `git commit -m "The commit message"`

---
# commit

<Image src={commit} style={{maxWith: '75%', maxHeight: '75%', backgroundSize: 'contain'}}/>

<ImageText>

```
Add .vscode to .gitignore

# Please enter the commit message for your changes. Lines starting
# with '#' will be ignored, and an empty message aborts the commit.
#
# On branch setup_scripts
# Your branch is up to date with 'origin/setup_scripts'.
#
# Changes to be committed:
#       new file:   .gitignore
#
# Untracked files:
#       git_aliases/
#
```

</ImageText>

# A quick vim digression

- git tends to default to using vim as its editor for commit messages
- To commit:
    - `i` (enter insert mode)
    - write your commit message
    - `<esc>` (back to command mode)
    - `:w` (save)
    - `:q` (quit)
- To set a different editor:
```
git config --global core.editor nano
```
---

# What about merging?
Merge the branch featureA into main:

```
git checkout main # make sure you're in main to start
git merge featureA
```

There are two scenarios:
<ul>
    <li>a fast-forward merge--your commits stack on top of the main branch</li>
    <li>a three-way merge</li>
</ul>

---


# Fast-Forward Merges

<TwoColumn>

<Column>

## before

<FFMergeBefore/>

<ImageText>
We have two branches: `main` and `some_branch`. There are three commits on
`main` before `some branch` splits off and makes two commits with messages
"start doing something" and "finish it up"
</ImageText>

</Column>

<Column>

## after

<FFMergeAfter/>

<ImageText>
We merge `some_branch` into `main`. `some_branch` no longer exists and `main` is
the only branch in the image. It contains the same three commits it did before,
_plus_ the two from `some_branch`.
</ImageText>

</Column>
</TwoColumn>

---

# Three-Way Merges

<TwoColumn>
    <Column>

## before

<MergeBefore/>
<ImageText>
In this example, we again have `some_branch` and `main` which diverge after
three commits. We have the same two commits on `some_branch`: "start doing
something" and "finish it up". However, `main` also has an additional commit
with message "main advances" _after_ `some_branch` split off.
</ImageText>
</Column>
<Column>

## after

<MergeAfter/>
<ImageText>
We again merge `some_branch` into `main`. Both `some_graph` and `main` remain in
the image. The tip of `main` is now at the "merge commit"--a commit created by
git with message "Merge branch some_branch".
</ImageText>
</Column>
</TwoColumn>

# Merge Conflicts

```
$ git diff main setup_scripts --name-only
.gitignore
setup.sh
$ git diff main conflict_demo --name-only
.gitignore
setup.sh
```

What happens when I try to merge setup_scripts into conflict_demo?<br/>

<Image src={conflict} style={{maxWidth:'75%', backgroundSize: 'contain'}}/>

<ImageText>

```
 ~/dotfiles   conflict_demo  git merge setup_scripts
 CONFLICT (add/add): Merge conflict in setup.sh
 Auto-merging setup.sh
 Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.
```

</ImageText>

# Resolving Conflicts

For each conflicted file:
- open the file and edit it, taking the lines from the version you want
    - caution: they may mix together in a way that results in broken code
- stage the file (`git add`)
Then, when you're done, `git commit`.

---

# More on confilcts...
<ul>
    <li>Editors often have a merge tool built to help</li>
    <li>Github also allows you to resolve conflicts in the pull-request UI</li>
</ul>

---

# .gitignore

- There's a special file called `.gitignore` which contains a list of files/directories that you want git to ignore
- These are usually things like files generated by your text editor/IDE or generated code
- Github will offer to make one for you or you can google for a "standard" list for the language you're using
